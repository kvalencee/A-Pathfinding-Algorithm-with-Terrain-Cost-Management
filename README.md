# A-Pathfinding-Algorithm-with-Terrain-Cost-Management
This project implements the A* pathfinding algorithm, optimized to handle different terrain types (e.g., water, sand, forest) with specific movement costs. It allows for dynamic pathfinding based on terrain, displays the discovery process, and visualizes the optimal path and solution tree.
